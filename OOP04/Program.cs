            //a) What is Abstraction in Object-Oriented Programming?
            //Abstraction in OOP is the concept of hiding complex internal
            //implementation details and exposing only the essential features of an object to the user.
            //b) Why is abstraction considered one of the four pillars of OOP?

            //a) What is the difference between an Abstract Class and an Interface?
            //Abstract Class: Represents an "is-a" relationship with shared code, fields, and constructors, but supports only single inheritance.
            //Interface: Represents a "can-do" capability defining a strict contract without fields or constructors, supporting multiple inheritance.
            //b) When would you choose an Interface instead of an Abstract Class?
            //Multiple Inheritance: A class needs to adopt multiple behaviors,
            //as C# supports implementing multiple interfaces but inheriting from only one base class.
            //Defining Capabilities ("can-do")
            //No Shared State / Code: You only need to enforce a behavioral contract without sharing instance fields, state, or default code logic.
            //c) Can a class inherit from multiple abstract classes? Can it implement multiple interfaces?
            //Multiple Abstract Classes: No. C# does not support multiple class inheritance.
            //Multiple Interfaces: Yes. A single class can implement multiple interfaces at the same time.
